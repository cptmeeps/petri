I am worried that the abstractions between the different systems and the core game mechanics are leaking, and will get me in trouble later. 
Can you check if there is any clean up I need to do. If there is can you explain to me why it's needed.
If there isn't any needed tell me why everything is ok the way it is. 

World-System Coupling
In MovementSystem and SpawnSystem, there's direct access to world.game_map. This creates tight coupling between systems and the world object. Systems should ideally be more independent and receive only what they need.
Create an interface layer between systems and the world:

Player System State Management
The PlayerSystem maintains its own list of players separate from the entities list in World. This could lead to synchronization issues.
Recommended Improvements
Implement a component query system in World to make it easier to find entities with specific components:

Direct Entity Component Access
Many systems directly access components through entity.get_component(). While not necessarily bad, it could make testing and modification more difficult.
Add an event system to reduce direct coupling:


Direct Access to Systems
In src/game.py and src/core/game_setup.py, you're directly accessing specific systems from the world's systems list:
Why This Is a Concern
Abstraction Leakage: By directly accessing systems, you're exposing the internal implementation details of the World class. This tight coupling can make your code harder to maintain and extend.
Responsibility Mixing: The game loop and setup code are taking on responsibilities that might be better encapsulated within the World or higher-level management classes.
Suggested Improvements
Encapsulate System Access: Modify the World class to provide methods for interacting with systems. For example:

Systems Exposing Public Methods
Some systems, like MovementSystem and UnitSystem, expose public methods that are called from outside:
Why This Is a Concern
ECS Paradigm Deviation: In a traditional ECS, systems operate internally during their update cycles, processing entities based on their components. Exposing methods can lead to out-of-order executions and unexpected side effects.
Maintenance Complexity: External calls to system methods can make debugging and maintaining the code more difficult, as the flow of data and control becomes less predictable.
Suggested Improvements
Use Events or Commands: Instead of calling system methods directly, consider implementing an event or command system where actions are queued and processed during the appropriate system's update cycle.

Tight Coupling Between Systems
There's a possibility of tight coupling if systems depend heavily on each other's internal workings or if changes in one system necessitate changes in another.
Why This Is a Concern
Reduced Modularity: If systems are not independent, it becomes challenging to modify or replace one without affecting others.
Scalability Issues: As your game grows, tightly coupled systems can lead to a tangled codebase that's hard to scale.
Suggested Improvements
Define Clear Interfaces: Ensure each system has a well-defined interface and interacts with other systems through these interfaces or shared components.
Use Shared Components for Communication: Systems can communicate indirectly by modifying components that other systems observe.
True
Avoid System-to-System Dependencies: Systems should not directly call methods on other systems. If they need to interact, consider using events or shared data structures.
